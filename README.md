##HOW TO: SMOOTH ACCORDION


1. In your HTML, make a wrapper div with a class of accordion

2. Make a div with masthead as the class within the accordion wrapper that will be what is shown as a tab of the accordion. Any content you drop in the div will be shown as your tab.

3. Make a div with content as the class below the masthead div (but not within) that will be the content within the tab. Any content you drop in the div will be shown when you click on the tab.

4. Make sure you have jQuery loaded in your html. Put it at the bottom of the body, below all your mark-up, so you don't look like a rookie.

5. Make sure you link your js file below the jQuery script so your js file can use jQuery. If the jQuery is below your js file, your js will not be able to use jQuery.
